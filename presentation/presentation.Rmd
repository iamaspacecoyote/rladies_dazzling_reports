## Goals of this tutorial

Introduce R tools that help you tell a data story in a professional, sustainable, and beautiful way. 

Specifically, 

- Set up your R ecosystem to support report creation
- Explore table and graphics packages to support analysis
- Produce an HTML report
- Produce a PDF report

## Stuff I won't cover

- Shiny - we are going to focus on HTML (primary) and PDF (secondary) reports
- Details of the table making or graphics packages - these could easily be their own tutorials

The good news is several speakers tomorrow will cover Shiny and other graphics applications!

This tutorial might feel a little bit 'meta' or abstract. 

## Digression on UX principles for reporting (and almost anything else)

 - Meet the usersâ€™ needs 
 - Have a clear hierarchy - navigation should be natural
 - Understand accessibility - did you know 1 in 12 men are colorblind?
 - Keep it consistent - transition to or away from ideas slowly
 - Narrative design - tell a story with your design
 
## Older process of reporting

- Do analysis in one tool (R)
- Make tables and charts in another tool (Excel)
- Paste everything into a text editor (Word)
- Turn it into a final product (PDF)

It works, but doesn't set you up for next time.

## Build an R ecosystem

- R project is the forest
- R markdown is the tree
- Tables and plots are the animals
    + Table building using `DT` or `reactable` (or others)
    + Plotting using `ggplot2` or `plotly`

## R Project 

R projects define your working directories. This helps keeps paths relative rather than fixed. This makes the work portable and lets you introduce folders to keep things tidy.

## R Markdown

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

- YAML Header
- Code chunks
- Markdown/LaTeX

## Tables

There are many table packages. I chose a couple that are good for HTML reports.

- `DT` - lighter weight starting point
- `reactable` - more advanced customization

## Plots

`ggplot2` works great on it's own. It can be enhanced by adding `plotly`.

## Tips

 - Keep longer R scripts separate from R markdown file
   + Consider outputting summary data set to avoid longer processes when you load a report
 - Use parameters in your R markdown file to make it more timeless
 - Don't try to fit too much into one report - store different reports in the same folder if it makes sense
