Packages I'm going to use

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
library(rmarkdown)
library(DT)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

```


```{r}
library(blscrapeR)
library(tidyverse)
df <- bls_api(c("CES2000000001", "CES7000000001","CES5500000001","CES6500000001"),
                startyear = 2000, endyear = 2020)  %>%
    dateCast() %>%
  select(date, seriesID, value) %>%
  mutate(seriesID = case_when(seriesID == "CES2000000001" ~ "Construction",
                              seriesID == "CES7000000001" ~ "Hospitality",
                              seriesID == "CES5500000001" ~ "Financial",
                              seriesID == "CES6500000001" ~ "Educ./Health Services"))

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Interactive Table

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
DT::datatable(df)
```

## Interactive Plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
myplot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = value, group = seriesID)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()

ggplotly(myplot)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
